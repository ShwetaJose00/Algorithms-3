# Algorithms-3
#Step 1: Height Weighted Quick Union with Path Compression code (UF_HWQUPC.java)


#Step2: Using the implementation of UF_HWQUPC.java, developed a UF ("union-find") client (HWQUPC_Solution.java) with "n" objects ranging from 5 to 10000 to determine the number of connections


#Step3: Evidence of the relationship between n (no. of objects) and m (connections) in attached doc
